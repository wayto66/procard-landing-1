        Works as follows:
        - Compile a list of all sort orders in the queryset. Leave out anything that
          isn't in the object_pks list - this deals with pagination and any
          inconsistencies.
        - Get the maximum among all model object sort orders. Update the queryset to add
          it to all the existing sort order values. This lifts them 'out of the way' of
          unique_together clashes when setting the intended sort orders.
        - Set the sort order on each object. Use only position values that the objects
          had before calling this method, so they get rearranged in place.
